**Programming language:** C++  
**Testing framework:** N/A

## Authors

## The code  
This program represents a simplified Black Jack game where the rules are currently based on the Atlantic City version.  

## Dependencies  
* Xcode  
 
## Setup  
To test this application you need to fork it to your own GitHub account and clone it to your local workspace. Once you have cloned the repository, you will be able to run the build inside of Xcode.  
  
If you do not have Xcode, you may also want to attempt to run the application directly in your CLI by entering the following command:  
```
$ g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp game_info.cpp game_play.cpp
$ ./a.out
```

## Instructions  
The game instructions are provided with the game itself.    

## Updates/Improvements  
Due to time constraints the current version of this application does not support the user choosing to convert the 'Ace' card to 1 or 11, thus it is by default 1.
